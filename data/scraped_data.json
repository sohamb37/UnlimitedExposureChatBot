Rust Check is an aftermarket product, but it will not void any factory warranties issued by the manufacture\\n\\nHow Long Does A Rust Check Application Take?\\n\\nA typical application takes approximately 1 Hour\\n\\nWhat Is Rust Check?\\n\\nRust Check is a premier automobile body panel protectant that has been used successfully since 1973. It is a light liquid product that is applied inside body sections as a pressurized spray.\\n\\nCrevice areas hidden inside body sections, such as joints, folds, seams and spot welds therein, are the places where corrosion starts and spreads from. Rust Check has the light liquid consistency and the active additives necessary to penetrate deep into and protect the many vulnerable crevices found in today\\'s vehicles.\\n\\nRust Check protects metals by displacing moisture and treating the surfaces with highly effective corrosion inhibitors. The corrosion inhibitors form an absorbed (bonded) layer on the metal surfaces. This microscopic layer acts like a series of tiny umbrellas, shielding the surface from water molecules. Just as a car battery will not work without its electrolyte, metal corrosion will not occur if moisture does not contact the metal.\\n\\nWhat Is Your Warranty?\\n\\nRust Check offers lifetime, annually renewable warranties to all vehicles less than one model year and to qualified vehicles up to three model years old.\\n\\nThis is not a money-back warranty – if a vehicle rusts from the inside out, we will pay for the repairs in accordance with the Warranty Certificate.\\n\\nThe warranty is transferable, and has no mileage restrictions.\\n\\nNOTE: The warranty is annually renewed when your vehicle is \"Rust Checked\" at any of over 250 Rust Check locations.\\n\\nCan Rust Check Be Applied To Vehicles Of All Ages?\\n\\nSealants provide a barrier between the metal and the environment, restricting contact of water and oxygen with the metal. In order to be effective, the sealant coating must remain intact. Consequently, sealant coating rely on good adhesion to the surface onto which they are applied.\\n\\nAccordingly, sealants are best applied to new metals or freshly and thoroughly cleaned and dried metals. If applied to corroded, dirty or wet surfaces, they may not adhere properly to the surface, resulting in a non-intact, unprotective coating. It is particularly difficult to thoroughly clean and dry out the critical crevices and inner body panels areas.\\n\\nIn contrast, Rust Check remains fluid and very mobile and can fill in pores and other voids found in deposits of rust or other corrosion products. Rust Check also provides good penetration into rusted crevices. In cases where crevices are already rusting, Rust Check\\'s deep penetration by capillary action is of even greater importance. The active additives in Rust Check work on a microscopic scale to displace water from metal surfaces and then keep the water from re-contacting the metal.\\n\\nRust Check Coat & Protect can adhere to and protect lightly rusted surfaces. It also contains a very high percentage of active additives to \"dry\" the metal surfaces and keep them dry. Rust Check Coat & Protect also has considerable acid neutralizing capability.\\n\\nAlthough Rust Check and Rust Check Coat & Protect will not reverse rusting that has already occurred, they will slow and control its spread.\\n\\nIs Rust Proofing worth it in Ontario and Canada?\\n\\nYes, rust proofing is one of the best investments for Canadian drivers. Ontario winters bring road salt, slush, and constant moisture, all of which accelerate corrosion. Rust Check rust proofing helps extend your vehicle’s lifespan, reduces expensive repair costs, and improves resale value. For drivers in Canada’s tough climate, professional rust protection is always worthwhile.\\n\\nWhen is the best time to apply Rust Protection in Canada?\\n\\nThe best time to apply rust protection is as soon as you purchase your vehicle, before rust can begin. However, Rust Check treatments can be applied year-round, even in winter. This flexibility ensures Canadian drivers are always able to protect their cars, regardless of season, against road salt, moisture, and temperature fluctuations.\\n\\nHow often should I get Rust Check treatments?\\n\\nRust Check is designed for annual application. Yearly treatments ensure that your vehicle remains consistently protected as road conditions, seasons, and exposure to salt and moisture change throughout Ontario and Canada. Regular maintenance provides the best defense against corrosion, extending vehicle life and keeping costs down compared to expensive rust repairs later on.\\n\\nWhat vehicles qualify for the Rust Check lifetime warranty?\\n\\nVehicles less than one model year old with low mileage may qualify for a Rust Check lifetime warranty. Older vehicles can still receive up to three years of coverage. This program gives Canadian drivers added assurance that their vehicles are protected long-term with trusted rust control that has been proven effective for over 50 years.\\n\\nDoes Rust Check improve resale value in Canada?\\n\\nYes, professional rust protection can increase resale value. Vehicles with a Rust Check history are viewed as well-maintained, making them more attractive in Canada’s used car market. Buyers trust vehicles with documented rust control treatments, giving sellers the advantage of higher resale prices while also reducing the buyer’s concerns about hidden corrosion damage\\n\\nWhy choose Rust Check over dealership rust proofing in Ontario?\\n\\nRust Check has provided trusted rust protection for over 50 years, while dealership rust proofing often comes as an upsell with less focus on specialized treatments. Our nationwide dealer network ensures reliable service, transparent pricing, and proven results. Ontario drivers choose Rust Check for effective, long-lasting rust control that dealerships cannot consistently guarantee.\\n\\nCan I apply a Rust Check in winter?\\n\\nYes, Rust Check can be applied any time of year, including winter. In fact, winter applications are particularly effective because vehicles are most exposed to salt and moisture. Canadian drivers don’t need to wait until warmer months; Rust Check ensures reliable corrosion protection even during Ontario’s harshest winter conditions.\\n\\nHow do I claim Rust Check warranty service?\\n\\nTo claim Rust Check warranty service, bring your warranty paperwork to any authorized dealer across Canada. Our national dealer network honors warranties for qualified vehicles. This ensures peace of mind for Ontario and Canadian drivers, knowing that their rust protection is backed by reliable coverage and support no matter where they are located.\\n\\nCan I transfer my Rust Check warranty if I sell my car?\\n\\nYes, many Rust Check warranties are transferable to new owners. This adds resale value by showing that the vehicle has been protected against corrosion. Buyers appreciate the added security, and sellers can benefit from higher offers in Ontario and Canada’s competitive used car markets when warranty protection is still active.\\n\\nWhere can I learn more about Rust Protection in Canada?\\n\\n[You can learn more about rust protection by visiting the Rust Check blog.](https://www.rustcheck.ca/blog.html) Our articles, seasonal care guides, and videos provide practical tips on preventing corrosion in Ontario and Canada.

It can be thought of as a thicker, more durable version of Rust Check, engineered with strong adhesion and excellent wash resistance. This makes it ideal for exposed undercarriage areas that face constant assaults from road salt, slush, water, gravel, and debris.\\n\\nUnlike traditional undercoatings that harden, crack, or peel over time, Coat & Protect is self-healing and flexible. It eliminates messy dripping from the undercarriage but never dries out, ensuring it continues to move with your vehicle. This flexibility is important because it prevents gaps from forming where corrosion could take hold. Whether applied to a brand-new car or a trusted older vehicle, Coat & Protect delivers reliable results and helps extend the life of your investment.\\n\\n![What is Coat & Protect?](https://rustcheck.ca/images/design/_LEO9346-cnp-5.jpg)\\n\\n## Built with Proven Corrosion Inhibitor\\n\\nCoat & Protect contains a very high percentage of the same proven corrosion inhibitors that have made Rust Check Canada’s most trusted rust protection system for over 50 years. These inhibitors actively block moisture and oxygen-the two elements rust needs to form-creating a protective shield across vulnerable metal surfaces. By combining a thicker, high-adhesion product for the undercarriage with Rust Check’s penetrating liquid spray for seams and joints, the system delivers complete inside-out protection.\\n\\n## [The Rust Check Two Product Process](https://www.rustcheck.ca/rust-check-application/rust-check-coat-protect/two-step-application-process.html)\\n\\nWhen used together, Rust Check Coat & Protect and Rust Check create a two-step process tailored to the different environments encountered across your vehicle. Rust Check penetrates deeply into hidden seams, doors, and welded joints where rust begins. Coat & Protect covers exposed, high-impact areas such as rocker panels, wheel wells, and the entire undercarriage. The result is premium-quality, dual-layer protection that adapts to real-world driving conditions in Ontario and across Canada.\\n\\n## Why Drivers Choose Coat & Protect\\n\\nCanadian winters are among the toughest in the world. Constant freeze-thaw cycles, wet slush, and heavy road salt create the perfect storm for corrosion. Coat & Protect was developed with this reality in mind. Its unique wash-resistant formula clings tightly to metal, even under continuous exposure to water spray and gravel. By shielding your undercarriage from rust, Coat & Protect helps:\\n\\n- Extend the lifespan of your vehicle.\\n\\n- Reduce expensive long-term repair bills.\\n\\n- Preserve resale value with a recognized protection record.\\n\\n- Provide peace of mind knowing your car is guarded year-round.\\n\\n\\n## Compatible with Today’s Vehicles\\n\\nCoat & Protect isn’t limited to traditional steel frames. It’s safe and effective for use on aluminum body panels, hybrids, and electric vehicles, making it a versatile solution for modern drivers. Like all Rust Check products, [it is applied by trained technicians at authorized centres across Canada](https://www.rustcheck.ca/rust-check-dealers-serach.html) and is backed by renewable, transferable warranties with unlimited mileage.\\n\\nRust Check Coat & Protect is more than an undercarriage product-it’s a proven system built for Canadian roads. By combining innovation, flexibility, and decades of trust, it helps.\\n\\n## Stop rust from reducing your vehicle’s value.\\n\\nBook your annual Rust Check today and discover why drivers across Ontario and Canada continue to choose us over traditional sealants.\\n\\n[Locate a **Rust Check Centre near you** with ease.](https://www.rustcheck.ca/rust-check-dealers-serach.html)\\n\\n**Thunder Bay Residents:**\\n\\n[If you’re in the Thunder Bay area, schedule your annual Rust Check at your local centre today](https://www.rustcheck.ca/rust-check-dealers-serach.html) and give your vehicle the reliable protection it needs to withstand harsh northern winters.\\n\\nWhat is Coat & Protect, and how is it different from Rust Proofing?\\n\\nCoat & Protect is our premium undercarriage treatment, designed with advanced corrosion inhibitors. Unlike traditional hard coatings that can crack and trap moisture, Coat & Protect stays flexible, sealing out salt, gravel, and water. This ensures lasting protection for the underside of your vehicle against Canada’s harsh road conditions, making it more reliable than standard rust proofing.\\n\\nDo I need both Rust Check and Coat & Protect?\\n\\nYes, using both provides the most complete protection. Rust Check is applied inside body panels and seams to stop corrosion where it starts, while Coat & Protect shields the undercarriage from external salt and debris. Together, these treatments give Canadian drivers a full rust control solution for year-round vehicle protection.\\n\\nIs Rust Check safe for electric vehicles?\\n\\nYes, Rust Check is completely safe for electric vehicles. Our non-conductive formula is carefully applied to avoid sensitive components while still protecting panels and seams from salt, slush, and moisture. With EV ownership growing across Ontario and Canada, Rust Check provides peace of mind by extending the lifespan of electric cars in harsh climates.\\n\\nDoes Rust Check void my new car warranty?\\n\\nNo, Rust Check does not void your new car warranty. Our rust protection works alongside factory coverage, adding protection in areas not covered by manufacturer warranties. Many Ontario and Canadian drivers choose Rust Check early, ensuring their new cars stay corrosion-free while keeping warranty coverage fully intact for additional peace of mind.\\n\\nDo new trucks in Ontario need Rust Proofing?\\n\\nYes, new trucks are immediately exposed to salt, gravel, and moisture on Ontario’s roads.

Rust doesn’t just make vehicles look old-it affects safety, performance, and resale value. That’s why drivers across Canada rely on Rust Check treatment, a proven rust proofing and rust protection system trusted for more than 50 years.\\n\\n## Why Choose Rust Check Over Basic Rust Proofing?\\n\\nMany drivers think undercoating or basic rust proofing is enough. The problem is, most undercoatings harden, crack, and actually trap moisture. Rust then forms underneath where you can’t see it.\\n\\nRust Check works differently. It uses a light, penetrating liquid spray that seeps deep into seams, joints, and panels-the places where corrosion really begins. This method delivers true rust control, keeping moisture out and protecting your vehicle from the inside out.\\n\\n## [Two-Step Rust Protection Designed for Canadian Winter](https://www.rustcheck.ca/rust-check-application/rust-check-coat-protect/two-step-application-process.html)\\n\\nA Rust Check treatment uses a dual-application system for maximum coverage:\\n\\n**Step One:** A thin liquid formula that penetrates hidden seams, doors, hood frames, and other vulnerable areas. It displaces water and stops rust at its source.\\n\\n**Step Two**: A thicker spray applied to exposed parts like wheel wells, rocker panels, and undercarriage. This layer clings tightly, shielding against salt, gravel, and road debris.\\n\\nTogether, these steps provide full rust proofing and rust control, making RustCheck the most complete rust protection program available in Ontario and across Canada.\\n\\n![Rust Check Treatment](https://rustcheck.ca/images/banner/rust_treatment.jpg)\\n\\n## What Areas Does Rust Check Cover?\\n\\nUnlike limited rust proofing, a Rust Check treatment is comprehensive. It targets over a dozen problem spots, including:\\n\\nEngine compartment and hood frame\\n\\nDoor posts, seams, and panels\\n\\nRocker panels and fender braces\\n\\nTrunk lid and hatch seams\\n\\nWheel wells, strut towers, and undercarriage\\n\\nElectrical connections, trailer hitch wiring, and light housings\\n\\nBy combining rust protection for both metal and electrical components, Rust Check ensures your vehicle stays safer, longer.\\n\\n## Rust Control for Every Type of Vehicle\\n\\nWhether you drive a family sedan, SUV, heavy-duty truck, or manage a commercial fleet, Rust Check adapts to your needs. Our rust proofing system is safe for electric vehicles, hybrids, and aluminum body panels-areas where standard rust protection products often fall short.\\n\\nCanadian businesses also trust Rust Check for fleet rust control, helping reduce downtime, extend service life, and lower long-term repair costs.\\n\\n## Built for Harsh Ontario and Canadian Winters\\n\\nCanada has one of the harshest driving environments in the world. Constant freeze-thaw cycles, heavy road salt, and wet slush create the perfect recipe for corrosion. Rust Check was developed specifically for this climate, [making it the go-to solution for rust protection in Ontario and nationwide.](https://rustcheck.ca/)\\n\\n## Why Rust Check Means Peace of Mind\\n\\nRust Check isn’t just about preventing surface damage-it’s about confidence. When you invest in Rust Proofing through Rust Check, you:\\n\\nExtend the lifespan of your vehicle\\n\\nReduce expensive body repair bills\\n\\nImprove resale value with a recognized rust protection record\\n\\nDrive with peace of mind knowing your car is protected against the elements\\n\\n[For over 50 years, Canadian drivers have chosen Rust Check as their rust control solution, making it a name trusted coast-to-coast.](https://rustcheck.ca/)\\n\\n## Ready to Book Your Rust Proofing Appointment?\\n\\nWith certified dealers across Ontario and Canada, it’s easy to get started. Use our Rust Check dealer locator to find a location near you, and schedule your appointment today. Protect your vehicle from salt, moisture, and rust with Canada’s most trusted rust protection system.\\n\\n## Don’t let rust lower your vehicle’s value.\\n\\nSchedule your annual Rust Check today and see why drivers across Ontario and Canada trust us over traditional sealants.\\n\\n[Find a **Rust Check Centre near you** anytime.](https://www.rustcheck.ca/rust-check-dealers-serach.html)\\n\\n**Thunder Bay Reminder:**\\n\\n[If you’re in the Thunder Bay area, book your annual Rust Check with your local centre today](https://www.rustcheck.ca/rust-check-dealers-serach.html) and give your vehicle the proven protection it needs to handle the challenges of northern winters.\\n\\nWhat is Rust Check, and how does it work?\\n\\nRust Check is a light, penetrating liquid spray applied inside body panels, seams, and hidden areas where rust typically begins. It seeps into cracks and crevices, displacing moisture and preventing corrosion. Trusted by Canadians since 1973, Rust Check provides year-round rust protection designed to withstand Ontario and Canada’s challenging driving conditions, including road salt and moisture.\\n\\nIs Rust Check safe for electric vehicles?\\n\\nYes, Rust Check is completely safe for electric vehicles. Our non-conductive formula is carefully applied to avoid sensitive components while still protecting panels and seams from salt, slush, and moisture. With EV ownership growing across Ontario and Canada, Rust Check provides peace of mind by extending the lifespan of electric cars in harsh climates.\\n\\nCan Rust Check protect aluminum body panels?\\n\\nYes, Rust Check is effective on vehicles with aluminum panels. While aluminum doesn’t rust like steel, it is prone to corrosion in Canadian conditions, especially with road salt exposure. Rust Check helps protect mixed-metal vehicles by reducing corrosion risks, ensuring that all vulnerable surfaces remain shielded from moisture and seasonal damage in Ontario’s climate\\n\\nWhat does a Rust Check treatment include for complete rust protection?\\n\\nA Rust Check treatment isn’t just basic rust proofing. It’s a full rust protection system that covers your engine compartment, undercarriage, rocker panels, door seams, and even electrical connections. By combining proven rust control methods with a two-step application, Rust Check gives Canadian drivers year-round protection against salt, slush, and moisture.\\n\\nHow is Rust Check different from traditional rust proofing?\\n\\nUnlike old-style rust proofing or hard undercoating that can crack and trap water, Rust Check uses a penetrating liquid spray for long-lasting rust control. It seeps into hidden seams, overlaps, and joints, stopping corrosion before it spreads. This makes Rust Check one of the most trusted rust protection solutions in Ontario and across Canada.\\n\\nIs Rust Check safe for electrical components during rust protection?\\n\\nYes. Rust Check’s rust protection formula is completely safe for wiring, lights, and electrical connections. It’s non-conductive and designed to coat sensitive areas without interference. This makes Rust Check stand out from basic rust proofing, giving Canadian drivers confidence in complete vehicle rust control without risking modern electronics.\\n\\nCan Rust Check rust protection be applied during winter in Ontario?\\n\\nAbsolutely. Rust Check treatments are effective year-round, including Ontario’s harsh winters. Unlike some rust proofing products, Rust Check penetrates even in cold weather, displacing moisture and salt. Canadian drivers often choose winter treatments because vehicles face the highest rust control risks when exposed to slush, road salt, and freezing conditions.\\n\\nHow long does a Rust Check rust proofing treatment last?\\n\\nRust Check treatments last for about one year under normal driving conditions. To maintain maximum rust control, an annual rust protection application is recommended. This schedule ensures your car, truck, or SUV stays consistently protected against Canada’s toughest threats-road salt, snow, and seasonal moisture that fuel corrosion year after year.\\n\\nDoes Rust Check help older vehicles with rust control?\\n\\nYes. While Rust Check can’t remove existing rust, it acts as ongoing rust protection by slowing corrosion and shielding surrounding areas. Many Canadian drivers apply Rust Check to older vehicles as a preventative rust proofing measure, extending their lifespan, cutting down repair bills, and maintaining reliable performance even in tough conditions.\\n\\nWhere can I get professional rust proofing with Rust Check in Ontario or Canada?\\n\\nRust Check has certified dealers offering rust protection and rust control services across Ontario and nationwide. Use the online dealer locator to find a service center near you and book your appointment.

For more than 50 years, this innovative product has been applied to vehicles across Ontario and nationwide, helping protect against rust in one of the toughest driving environments in the world.\\n\\nUnlike heavy coatings or sealants that sit on the surface, Rust Check is a light liquid that is applied inside body sections as a pressurized spray. This unique formula has the consistency and active additives needed to penetrate deeply into the hidden crevices of modern vehicles. Joints, folds, seams, and spot welds-these are the areas where rust typically starts, and once corrosion begins, it spreads quickly. By targeting these hidden points of weakness, Rust Check provides protection exactly where it’s needed most.\\n\\n![What is Rust Check?](https://www.rustcheck.ca/images/design/whatis_RC.jpg)\\n\\n## How Rust Check Works\\n\\nRust Check doesn’t just cover metal-it actively displaces moisture from the surfaces. Moisture is the fuel for corrosion, and if it can’t reach the metal, rust cannot form. Once applied, Rust Check leaves behind a microscopic layer of corrosion inhibitors that bond to the metal. Think of these inhibitors as thousands of tiny invisible umbrellas: each one creates a barrier that shields the surface from water molecules.\\n\\nThis approach is different from traditional undercoatings or sealants, which can harden, crack, and trap moisture. Rust Check remains mobile, allowing it to creep into new seams and folds, continuing to protect even as your vehicle vibrates, flexes, and settles over time.\\n\\n## Why Rust Check is Essential for Canadian Drivers\\n\\nDriving through a Canadian winter means exposure to road salt, slush, and repeated freeze-thaw cycles. These conditions accelerate rust faster than almost anywhere else. Vehicles without proper rust protection often suffer from corroded panels, weakened frames, and costly repairs.\\n\\nBy applying Rust Check annually, drivers can:\\n\\n- Extend the lifespan of their vehicles by preventing hidden corrosion.\\n\\n- Improve safety by maintaining the strength of body panels and structural components.\\n\\n- Save money on expensive rust repairs and body work.\\n\\n- Preserve resale value, as vehicles with a recognized rust protection history are more attractive to buyers.\\n\\n\\n## A Proven System Since 1973\\n\\nFor more than five decades, Rust Check has built a reputation for delivering results. [Applied by trained technicians at authorized Rust Check centres across Canada, the product has been trusted by families, businesses, and fleets alike.](https://www.rustcheck.ca/rust-check-dealers-serach.html) Unlike one-time treatments that eventually fail, Rust Check is designed to be renewed annually, ensuring ongoing protection year after year. Many applications are backed by transferable warranties, providing peace of mind even if you sell or trade your vehicle.\\n\\n## Rust Check Today\\n\\nRust Check remains the gold standard in corrosion protection. Whether you drive a compact car, SUV, pickup truck, or even an electric or hybrid vehicle with aluminum body panels, Rust Check is safe, effective, and tailored to modern automotive needs.\\n\\nIn short, Rust Check is more than a product-it’s peace of mind. By displacing moisture, shielding hidden seams, and providing ongoing protection since 1973, it ensures your vehicle stays safer, stronger, and rust-free for years to come.\\n\\n## Don’t let rust take away your vehicle’s value.\\n\\nSchedule your annual Rust Check today and see why drivers across Ontario and Canada trust us instead of traditional sealants.\\n\\n[Easily find a **Rust Check Centre near you**.](https://www.rustcheck.ca/rust-check-dealers-serach.html)\\n\\n**Thunder Bay Notice:**\\n\\n[For those in the Thunder Bay area, book your annual Rust Check at your local centre today](https://www.rustcheck.ca/rust-check-dealers-serach.html) and give your vehicle the proven protection it needs to stand strong through tough northern winters.\\n\\nHow long does Rust Check rust protection last?\\n\\nRust Check treatments are designed to provide protection for an entire year. They shield your vehicle through every season, including Ontario’s harsh winters. For best results, we recommend annual reapplications, ensuring your car stays fully protected from moisture, road salt, and other corrosive elements commonly encountered across Canada.\\n\\nWhat’s the difference between Rust Check, Rust Control, and Rust Proofing?\\n\\nRust Check is our specialized spray-in liquid treatment designed to protect vehicle panels and seams. Rust Control describes our comprehensive approach, combining products and processes to prevent corrosion across the vehicle. Rust Proofing is the general industry term for all anti-rust treatments. Together, these ensure complete protection from the harsh climates across Ontario and Canada.\\n\\nCan Rust Check stop existing rust?\\n\\nRust Check cannot remove or reverse rust that has already formed, but it can slow its progression. By coating corroded areas and protecting surrounding metal, Rust Check helps reduce further damage. Many Canadian drivers use it to extend the lifespan of older vehicles and minimize additional repair costs caused by spreading rust.\\n\\nDoes Rust Check void my new car warranty?\\n\\nNo, Rust Check does not void your new car warranty. Our rust protection works alongside factory coverage, adding protection in areas not covered by manufacturer warranties. Many Ontario and Canadian drivers choose Rust Check early, ensuring their new cars stay corrosion-free while keeping warranty coverage fully intact for additional peace of mind.\\n\\nIs Rust Check environmentally safe?\\n\\nYes, Rust Check products are non-toxic, biodegradable, and safe for the environment. Our formulas are designed to be highly effective against rust while also meeting environmental standards. For Canadian drivers, this means you can protect your vehicle from corrosion without compromising on sustainability, making Rust Check a safe choice for both cars and the planet.\\n\\n[Home](https://rustcheck.ca/index.php) \\\\| [Why RustCheck](https://rustcheck.ca/rust-check-products/rust-check-over-sealants.html) \\\\| [Application](https://rustcheck.ca/rust-check-application/rust-check-coat-protect/what-is-coat-protect.html) \\\\| [Pricing](https://rustcheck.ca/pricing.html) \\\\|\\xa0 [Media](https://rustcheck.ca/rust-check-media/rust-check-video.html) \\\\| [RustCheck Dealer Near Me](https://rustcheck.ca/rust-check-dealers-serach.html) \\\\|\\xa0 [F.A.Q](https://rustcheck.ca/rust-check-products/f-a-q.html) \\\\| [Contact Us](https://rustcheck.ca/contact-rust-check.html)\\n\\n[![www.rustcheck.ca](https://www.rustcheck.ca/images/logo_1.png)](https://www.rustcheck.ca/)\\n\\n[Close Off-canvas](https://www.rustcheck.ca/rust-check-application/rust-check-coat-protect/what-is-rust-check.html#)\\n\\n- [Facebook](https://www.rustcheck.ca/rust-check-application/rust-check-coat-protect/what-is-rust-check.html#)\\n- [Twitter](https://www.rustcheck.ca/rust-check-application/rust-check-coat-protect/what-is-rust-check.html#)\\n- [Pinterest](https://www.rustcheck.ca/rust-check-application/rust-check-coat-protect/what-is-rust-check.html#)\\n- [Instagram](https://www.rustcheck.ca/rust-check-application/rust-check-coat-protect/what-is-rust-check.html#)' html=None raw_html=None json=None summary=None metadata=DocumentMetadata(title='What Is RustCheck? | Advanced Corrosion Protection Since 1973', description='Rust Check is Canada’s #1 rust protection, trusted since 1973.

What makes Rust Check different is its unique Two-Step Application Process, a system designed to provide complete protection by addressing both the hidden areas inside your vehicle and the exposed undercarriage surfaces.\\n\\nEvery vehicle is made up of thousands of seams, folds, joints, and weld points. These areas are highly vulnerable to moisture and salt but require different solutions. One product alone cannot effectively protect the entire vehicle. That is why Rust Check uses two complementary products—Rust Check and Rust Check Coat & Protect—each tailored to specific areas of your car or truck.\\n\\n![Rust Check Two-Step Application Process](https://rustcheck.ca/images/design/rust_panel.jpg)\\n\\n## Step 1: Rust Check (Inside Body Panels and Hidden Areas)\\n\\nModern vehicles are full of hidden crevices-places you can’t see but where corrosion begins. Inside doors, quarter panels, fenders, trunk lids, and around spot welds, road salt and moisture collect and create the perfect conditions for rust to spread.\\n\\nRust Check is a light, oil-based liquid that is applied as a pressurized spray. Its thin consistency allows it to penetrate deeply into seams and crevices where thicker coatings simply cannot reach. Once inside, Rust Check displaces moisture and leaves behind a protective layer of corrosion inhibitors. This invisible barrier bonds to the metal, preventing water and oxygen from making contact-the two key elements rust needs to form.\\n\\nBecause it remains active and mobile, Rust Check continues to creep into new seams over time. The result is superior protection for the structural integrity of your vehicle, reducing the risk of hidden rust that can weaken panels and compromise safety.\\n\\n![Rust Check Two-Step Application Process](https://rustcheck.ca/images/design/rust_bent.jpg)\\n\\n## Step 2: Rust Check Coat & Protect (Undercarriage and Exposed Areas)\\n\\nWhile Step 1 protects the inside, the undercarriage is constantly exposed to harsh Canadian driving conditions. Salt, slush, gravel, and water spray attack the bottom of your vehicle daily throughout the winter months. This is where Rust Check Coat & Protect comes in.\\n\\nCoat & Protect is a premium undercarriage treatment that forms an adhesive, wash-resistant, and self-healing film. Unlike traditional undercoatings that harden, crack, or trap moisture, Coat & Protect remains flexible and durable. It eliminates dripping, resists wash-off, and continues to protect even when exposed to gravel impact or road spray.\\n\\nIn addition to shielding against rust, Coat & Protect enhances the appearance of the undercarriage and lubricates as it protects-offering both cosmetic and functional benefits.\\n\\n## Why the Two-Step System Works\\n\\nBy combining both products, Rust Check provides complete inside-out protection:\\n\\n- Rust Check penetrates the seams, folds, and hidden areas where rust begins.\\n\\n- Coat & Protect guards the exposed undercarriage and high-impact zones.\\n\\n- Together, they form a dual barrier that keeps corrosion from taking hold.\\n\\n\\nThis system has been trusted since 1973 and is applied only by trained technicians at authorized Rust Check centres. It’s backed by renewable, transferable warranties, giving drivers peace of mind and long-term value.\\n\\n## Built for Canadian Roads\\n\\nCanada’s climate is one of the harshest for vehicles. Road salt, freezing rain, and constant freeze-thaw cycles accelerate rust at an alarming rate. The Rust Check Two-Step Application Process was developed specifically for these conditions, ensuring drivers across Ontario and Canada have the protection they need year after year.\\n\\nThe Rust Check Two-Step Application Process is more than just a treatment-it’s a proven system that helps extend vehicle life, maintain safety, reduce costly repairs, and preserve resale value.\\n\\n## Protect your vehicle’s value from rust.\\n\\nBook your annual Rust Check today and see why drivers across Ontario and Canada continue to choose us over traditional sealants.\\n\\n[Find a **Rust Check Centre near you** quickly and easily.](https://www.rustcheck.ca/rust-check-dealers-serach.html)\\n\\n**Thunder Bay Residents:**\\n\\n[If you’re in the Thunder Bay area, schedule your annual Rust Check with your local centre today](https://www.rustcheck.ca/rust-check-dealers-serach.html) and give your vehicle the trusted protection it needs to withstand harsh northern winters.\\n\\nWhat is the Rust Check two-step application?\\n\\nThe Rust Check two-step application uses two specially formulated products. A light, penetrating spray is applied inside hidden seams and body panels, while a thicker product coats exposed areas. This combination ensures highly effective corrosion protection, even in Ontario and Canada’s toughest driving conditions, where moisture, road salt, and temperature changes create high rust risks.\\n\\nIs Rust Proofing necessary in Ontario winters?\\n\\nYes, Ontario winters make rust proofing essential. Heavy road salt, slush, and freezing conditions accelerate corrosion on all vehicles. Rust Check treatments are designed to protect Canadian drivers year-round, ensuring vehicles stay reliable and resistant to rust despite harsh winter road treatments and extreme seasonal changes common across Ontario and surrounding provinces.\\n\\nDo I need Rust Protection if I live in Western Canada?\\n\\nYes, rust protection is necessary in Western Canada. While salt may be used less frequently, vehicles are still exposed to moisture, rain, and mud, all of which contribute to corrosion. Rust Check provides reliable year-round protection for drivers in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and other western regions, helping vehicles last longer in diverse climates.\\n\\nIs Rust Proofing necessary if I don’t drive much in Ontario?\\n\\nYes, even low-mileage or parked vehicles can develop rust. Condensation and moisture build up on metal surfaces whether or not the vehicle is driven. Ontario’s climate accelerates this process. Applying Rust Check ensures that cars, even when used infrequently, remain protected from rust damage and maintain their long-term value.\\n\\nCan I wash my car right after Rust Check?\\n\\nYes, you can wash your car after Rust Check treatment, but avoid heavy power washing directly on treated panels for at least 24 hours. Gentle rinsing is fine. This gives the product time to settle and ensures optimal protection, helping Ontario drivers keep vehicles both clean and corrosion-free.\\n\\n[Home](https://rustcheck.ca/index.php) \\\\| [Why RustCheck](https://rustcheck.ca/rust-check-products/rust-check-over-sealants.html) \\\\| [Application](https://rustcheck.ca/rust-check-application/rust-check-coat-protect/what-is-coat-protect.html) \\\\| [Pricing](https://rustcheck.ca/pricing.html) \\\\|\\xa0 [Media](https://rustcheck.ca/rust-check-media/rust-check-video.html) \\\\| [RustCheck Dealer Near Me](https://rustcheck.ca/rust-check-dealers-serach.html) \\\\|\\xa0 [F.A.Q](https://rustcheck.ca/rust-check-products/f-a-q.html) \\\\| [Contact Us](https://rustcheck.ca/contact-rust-check.html)\\n\\n[![www.rustcheck.ca](https://www.rustcheck.ca/images/logo_1.png)](https://www.rustcheck.ca/)\\n\\n[Close Off-canvas](https://www.rustcheck.ca/rust-check-application/rust-check-coat-protect/two-step-application-process.html#)\\n\\n- [Facebook](https://www.rustcheck.ca/rust-check-application/rust-check-coat-protect/two-step-application-process.html#)\\n- [Twitter](https://www.rustcheck.ca/rust-check-application/rust-check-coat-protect/two-step-application-process.html#)\\n- [Pinterest](https://www.rustcheck.ca/rust-check-application/rust-check-coat-protect/two-step-application-process.html#)\\n- [Instagram](https://www.rustcheck.ca/rust-check-application/rust-check-coat-protect/two-step-application-process.html#)' html=None raw_html=None json=None summary=None metadata=DocumentMetadata(title='RustCheck Two-Step Application Process | Optimal Corrosion Protection', description='Discover Rust Check’s Two-Step Application Process.

This residue not only affects the appearance of your truck, but can also attack the joints and spot welds that hold your truck together. The result is a truck that not only doesn\\'t look good, but will eventually become unsafe.\\n\\nOther so-called \"rust proofing\" systems use tars and waxes which are not effective in stopping corrosion. They are too thick and do not seep into the tight areas where corrosion begins. In fact, some of them actually \"trap in\" unwanted moisture and accelerate corrosion.\\n\\nRust Check\\'s unique capillary action allows protection to \"creep\" into the tight seams and crevices where salt and moisture can settle, driving them off and away from the metal surfaces of your truck for maximum prolonged protection.\\n\\n## Rust Check Total Maintenance\\n\\nComplete underside of cabs and trailers\\n\\nRocker panels and inside front wheel wells & liners\\n\\nFenders and fender braces, complete hood and fire wall\\n\\nSlack adjusters, fifth wheel and sliders\\n\\nLeaf springs and sub-frame\\n\\nJumper cord receptical\\n\\nAir brake maxi pots\\n\\nTransmission case, oil pan, battery box\\n\\nFuel tank, clamps and supporters\\n\\nAll electrical wiring, fittings and connections, including behind headlights, turn indicators, clearance lights, tail light assembly, around cab lights and horn\\n\\nApply to all trim, bumpers, chrome moldings, cowls, mirrors, headlights, pots, adjusters, cab steps etc.\\n\\nCab roof, around windshield, windshield and door pillars, doors, locks, door handles\\n\\n## Make Rust Check part of your truck\\'s regular maintenance program for complete year round protection against rust!\\n\\nRust Check is a unique formula that penetrates into every crevice and seam, actually bonding to metal to displace and lock out moisture in critical rust-prone areas.\\n\\nRust Check cleans and protects your electrical system to ensure worry free operation year after year.\\n\\nRust Check helps to prevent door lock \"freeze up\" and lubricates moving parts such as power window and door mechanisms.\\n\\nRust Check penetrates and lubricates nuts and bolts to prevent them from seizing\\n\\nRust Check helps to eliminate squeaks and rattles and ensures hinges and cables operate smoothly.\\n\\nSince Rust Check actually dispels water it can be applied at any time of the year, in any type of weather.\\n\\nRust Check has a proven reputation for total protection and will enhance the resale value of your truck.\\n\\nRust Check is thoroughly applied by our professionally trained and certified technicians.\\n\\n## Rust Check!

Rust proofing with Rust Check ensures your truck starts strong, preventing rust before it forms. Beginning early extends the vehicle’s lifespan, protects its resale value, and keeps repair costs low. Rust Check is trusted nationwide for protecting new and used trucks.\\n\\nHow do I maintain my vehicle after Rust Proofing?\\n\\nMaintaining your car after Rust Check treatment is simple. Wash your vehicle regularly, especially the undercarriage during winter months, to remove salt and debris. Following seasonal care advice helps prolong rust protection. Rust Check also provides blogs, tips, and resources to keep Canadian drivers informed about ongoing vehicle care for maximum corrosion control.\\n\\n[Home](https://rustcheck.ca/index.php) \\\\| [Why RustCheck](https://rustcheck.ca/rust-check-products/rust-check-over-sealants.html) \\\\| [Application](https://rustcheck.ca/rust-check-application/rust-check-coat-protect/what-is-coat-protect.html) \\\\| [Pricing](https://rustcheck.ca/pricing.html) \\\\|\\xa0 [Media](https://rustcheck.ca/rust-check-media/rust-check-video.html) \\\\| [RustCheck Dealer Near Me](https://rustcheck.ca/rust-check-dealers-serach.html) \\\\|\\xa0 [F.A.Q](https://rustcheck.ca/rust-check-products/f-a-q.html) \\\\| [Contact Us](https://rustcheck.ca/contact-rust-check.html)\\n\\n[![www.rustcheck.ca](https://www.rustcheck.ca/images/logo_1.png)](https://www.rustcheck.ca/)\\n\\n[Close Off-canvas](https://www.rustcheck.ca/rust-check-application/fleets-information/why-rust-check-your-truck.html#)\\n\\n- [Facebook](https://www.rustcheck.ca/rust-check-application/fleets-information/why-rust-check-your-truck.html#)\\n- [Twitter](https://www.rustcheck.ca/rust-check-application/fleets-information/why-rust-check-your-truck.html#)\\n- [Pinterest](https://www.rustcheck.ca/rust-check-application/fleets-information/why-rust-check-your-truck.html#)\\n- [Instagram](https://www.rustcheck.ca/rust-check-application/fleets-information/why-rust-check-your-truck.html#)' html=None raw_html=None json=None summary=None metadata=DocumentMetadata(title='Why RustCheck Your Truck | Fleet Protection & ROI', description='Protect your fleet with Rust Check — reduce costly rust damage, extend vehicle service life, and minimize maintenance costs by keeping trucks corrosion-free.', url='https://www.rustcheck.ca/rust-check-application/fleets-information/why-rust-check-your-truck.html', language='en-gb', keywords=None, robots='max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1', og_title=None, og_description=None, og_url=None, og_image=None, og_audio=None, og_determiner=None, og_locale=None, og_locale_alternate=None, og_site_name=None, og_video=None, favicon='https://www.rustcheck.ca/images/logo_1.png', dc_terms_created=None, dc_date_created=None, dc_date=None, dc_terms_type=None, dc_type=None, dc_terms_audience=None, dc_terms_subject=None, dc_subject=None, dc_description=None, dc_terms_keywords=None, modified_time=None, published_time=None, article_tag=None, article_section=None, source_url='https://www.rustcheck.ca/rust-check-application/fleets-information/why-rust-check-your-truck.html', status_code=200, scrape_id='019b125b-6eb7-709e-9401-dff5929d2d37', num_pages=None, content_type='text/html; charset=utf-8', proxy_used='basic', timezone='America/New_York', cache_state='miss', cached_at=None, credits_used=1, concurrency_limited=None, concurrency_queue_duration_ms=None, error=None, viewport='width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no', generator='Helix Ultimate - The Most Popular Joomla!
